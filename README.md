Byte Me – NOVAHacks 2025

In a world where everyone’s building faster, louder, more, we wanted to build something that felt like a breath. Byte Me isn’t just a team—it’s a signal in the noise, a handful of minds colliding over a single question: What if we made something that mattered?

From April 14th to 20th, across time zones and midnight brainstorms, Byte Me came together for NOVAHacks—an all-virtual space where innovation meets insomnia and ideas stretch just a little further than we thought they could. Our project was born from that in-between: not just to compete, but to create with intention.

We laughed, we debugged, we hit run (and watched it crash). Then we rebuilt. This is what came out the other side.

Welcome to Byte Me.
Built from scratch.
Shipped with heart.
