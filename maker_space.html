    <h1>NOVA FAB LAB</h1>

    <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
    <p>Food is essential to our individual and societal well-being, as well as our physical and emotional health. It connects us across cultures, generations, and communities; it embodies nourishment, traditions, and innovation. As we navigate the world, how we grow, access, cook, serve, and package food is critical in shaping our personal experiences. Whether in urban or rural areas, in homes or restaurants, or in the context of homegrown meals or industrialized food, there is always room for improvement.</p>
    <p>The NOVA Fab Lab challenges you to design a physical product that improves any aspect of the food system, including growing, accessibility, preparation, and how food is served or stored. Consider how your product design could enhance community, nutrition, convenience, or sustainability and address challenges people face when interacting with food.</p>
    <h2>Design Categories:  </h2>
    <h4>Food Accessibility</h4>
    <p>Many people want to grow their food but face space, time, or knowledge challenges. Design a physical product that makes gardening more accessible, efficient, or user-friendly, allowing people to grow food in small or untraditional spaces or without a green thumb.</p>
