    <h1>Design Challenge</h1>
    <p>Food is essential to our individual and societal well-being, as well as our physical and emotional health. It connects us across cultures, generations, and communities; it embodies nourishment, traditions, and innovation. As we navigate the world, how we grow, access, cook, serve, and package food is critical in shaping our personal experiences. Whether in urban or rural areas, in homes or restaurants, or in the context of homegrown meals or industrialized food, there is always room for improvement.</p>
    <p>The NOVA Fab Lab challenges you to design a physical product that improves any aspect of the food system, including growing, accessibility, preparation, and how food is served or stored. Consider how your product design could enhance community, nutrition, convenience, or sustainability and address challenges people face when interacting with food.</p>
    <h2>Design Categories:  </h2>
    <h4>Food Accessibility</h4>
    <p>Many people want to grow their food but face space, time, or knowledge challenges. Design a physical product that makes gardening more accessible, efficient, or user-friendly, allowing people to grow food in small or untraditional spaces or without a green thumb.</p>
    <h4>Enhancing the Cooking and Dining Experience</h4>
    <p>Design a physical product that improves the cooking and dining experience, making it more convenient, enjoyable, and creative. This could include tools that streamline meal prep, elevate the cooking process, or make serving and dining more effortless or engaging.</p>
    <h4>Serving and Cultural Food Traditions</h4>
    <p>Explore a food tradition that involves cooking or serving food in a culturally meaningful way (e.g., communal meals, food preparation, unique to specific regions), and modernize or enhance the experience without losing the cultural or social essence.</p>
    <h4>Reducing Waste in Households or Restaurants</h4>
    <p>Create a physical product that helps reduce packaging or food waste by promoting sustainability in households or businesses. The solution could aim to minimize packaging waste, extend food shelf life, or incorporate reusable, biodegradable, or compostable materials to help reduce overall waste.</p>
