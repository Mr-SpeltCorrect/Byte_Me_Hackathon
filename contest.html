    <h1>NASA Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students</h1>
    <p>NASA Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students (NASA SUITS) is a design challenge in which college students from across the country help design user interface solutions for future spaceflight needs. NASA’s Artemis missions seek to land the first woman and first person on the moon and build to a sustained human presence on the Moon and ultimately, Mars. This means engineers are actively developing technologies needed to assure successful completion of science and exploration missions. As humanity pushes further into the space it is essential that crewmembers on spacewalks be equipped with the appropriate new technologies necessary for the elevated demands of surface exploration on the Moon and Mars.  By participating in the NASA SUITS challenge, you can play a part in revolutionizing the human spaceflight experience!</p>
