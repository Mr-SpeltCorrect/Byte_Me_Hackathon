    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <p>NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery. For more than 65 years, NASA has made the seemingly impossible, possible. At its 20 centers and facilities across the country and with U.S. commercial companies and international partners, NASA leads studying Earth science, including climate, our Sun, solar system, and the larger universe. We conduct cutting-edge research to advance technology and aeronautics. We operate the worldâ€™s leading space laboratory, the International Space Station, and will establish a sustainable and strong exploration presence on the Moon this decade through the Artemis campaign..</p>

    <h1>Coding rules</h1>
    <div class="rules">
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.</li>
        <li>All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.</li>
        <li>Avoid heap memory allocation after initialization.</li>
        <li>Restrict functions to a single printed page.</li>
        <li>Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.</li>
        <li>Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.</li>
        <li>Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.</li>
        <li>Use the preprocessor only for header files and simple macros.</li>
        <li>Limit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers.</li>
        <li>Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software.</li>
      </ul>
